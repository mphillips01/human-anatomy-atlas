        <p>
          The hardware is friendly for those who wear glasses but has the potential to cause headaches in some users because of the AR features that it takes pride in. The lenses on the glasses appear to be made with a flimsy plastic-like material, but they manage to deal with the colors wonderfully, even if it does end up giving the user headaches. The stylus that comes with the device is not always registered, despite being in the view of the cameras that surround the laptop screen. The program itself contains a multitude of information and clicking on the different body parts makes it easy for the user to discover what specific parts are. The menus aren't labeled and it can be slightly confusing to figure out what specific icons do, but once you know what buttons do it can be easy to use the program. However there are some issues that can make the experience a little bit frusterating, such as the fact that if you use this program after using a different program, the controls may not be the same which can throw off the user who might be expecting consistancy. The controls alone, if the user decides to use this program and this program alone, are very easy to get used to and if you need to you are able to use the computer mouse instead of the stylus. If you bring the model of the human body up too close to the screen, it can go over the menu buttons which can be frusterating if you are trying to write or make a note on a specific part and need the body up super close.
